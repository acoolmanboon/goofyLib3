# GoofyLib3 - Simple OpenGL Helper Library

Goofylib3 is basically just a opengl helper, it doesnt really abstract much stuff but it lets people not experience the actual pain of making their own opengl engine
goofylib3 should be MOSTLY backwards compatible i will try

also goofylib3 is based on like 4 other older opengl engines that failed to work

## Features

- uses glfw so you can have many windows (SO GOOD!)
- compiles your shaders for you (SO easY!) also you can have many shaders
- automatically does batch rendering with automatic offsets so you can avoid doing the true PAIN of opengl
- Simple mesh loading from OBJ files and mesh manipulation utilities
- Texture array support with easy loading of textures into layers
- Helper functions for mesh transformations and debugging
